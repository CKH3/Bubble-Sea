# BubbleGame
 
Is my life as a mermaid destined to be as fleeting as a bubble, disappearing instantly? I refuse to accept that! 
難道我作爲人魚的人生，就注定和泡沫一樣短暫，稍縱即逝就會消失嗎？我不會接受！

In Bubble Sea, a thrilling single-player experience, you need to control a pearl in its bubble in a deep-sea environment, collecting more bubbles. Like my journey, the player must keep track of oxygen levels while navigating through enemies. As you collect bubbles to restore your body,  you will continue to live, just as you explore various layers of the sea. You start with normal sea animals, but they encounter bizarre creatures lurking as you dive deeper. 
 
Will the end of the sea be my home? 
Huh, I have so many bubbles—could it be that I can finally come back to life?

How to Play:
- Control Your Pearl: Use the arrow or WASD keys to guide your character through the underwater landscape
- Manage Oxygen: Keep an eye on your oxygen level. It depletes over time, so collect Oxygen to restore it
- Collect Points: Gather Pearls for points
- Escape from Enemies: Watch out for various sea creatures that can damage or pop your bubble

Gameplay Hints:
- Prioritize Collectibles: Focus on collecting Oxygen to ensure your survival.
- Explore Depth Variations: Each depth level features different enemies and Pearls. Be cautious as you go deeper.
- Check Point: Do not forget to go to the shell to save the progress so when you die, you do not need to start from level 1

Walkthrough Tips:
1. Start at Shallow Depths and familiarise yourself with the controls and pearls collection.
2. Collect Oxygen regularly to avoid oxygen depletion.
3. Anticipate enemy movements and plan your dives strategically.
4. Go to the shell to save the progress
5. Go to the bottom of the sea, win~~!!!
